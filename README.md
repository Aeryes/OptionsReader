# OptionsReader
This Python project uses live data from TD Ameritrade to calculate the best performing options chains of the day. The project is designed to try and provide an edge when it comes to purchasing options contracts or finding good plays to enter.

I was planning to take this project further than its intial stages for use with my own trading strategies but I found already existing tools that do this in a more efficient way.This project will hopefully serve as an introduction to working with the TD Ameritrade API, as well as an introduction to processing the recieved data from their API.

## Note:
In main.py you will need enter your own consumer-key before using this project.
